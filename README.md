# Bacteria_finder
My future hypothetical diploma project

In this branch new versions of program will be published. The current version is: 0.1

The most recent .exe file was generated by using PyInstaller command:
"pyinstaller Bacteria_finder_v.0.2_main_window.py --name Bacteria_finder_v.0.2 --paths=../Bacteria_finder_core --paths=../ --add-data ../Bacteria_finder_GUI/blank.png;./Bacteria_finder_GUI --hidden-import Bacteria_finder_core --add-data ../Bacteria_finder_core/trained_model_masks_MobileNetV2_2M_v3.pt;./Bacteria_finder_core"
You can also build it with the .spec file provided.

Version 0.2:
1) Added objects counter. Now number of objects (All, bacillus, coccus, groups, misc) will be displayed automatically
2) Added buttons to switch the display of different objects. E.x. if 'Coccus' is toggled, only coccus will be displayed
3) Internal code changes and small optimizations

Version 0.1.1:
Optimized imports for load speed up purposes.

Version 0.1:
1) Added functionality of loading, segmenting, classifying and saving images.
2) After segmenting and classifying the results are stored in program, so you can switch between two verions 
of the picture without recalculating
3) The saved image is the one currently displayed, but with the size of the original image
