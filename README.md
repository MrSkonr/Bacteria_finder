My future hypothetical diploma project

In this branch new versions of program will be published. The current version is: 0.1

Version 0.1:
1) Added functionality of loading, segmenting, classifying and saving images.
2) After segmenting and classifying the results are stored in program, so you can switch between two verions 
of the picture without recalculating
3) The saved image is the one currently displayed, but with the size of the original image
